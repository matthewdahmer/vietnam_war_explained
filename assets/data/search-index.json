Antiwar protests drew many to activist circles, which from there brought people into feminist, civil rights, and black power groups among others. Those who saw the violence perpetrated by their country often felt more sympathy for the Vietnamese than for the US government. Many within the antiwar movement were soldiers and veterans who sought an end to the conflict after witnessing it firsthand. Veteran\u2019s Protests Veteran groups like VVAW (Vietnam Veterans Against the War) organized large scale protests in Washington DC and advocated for Vietnam Veterans within public discourse. Many of these groups, the VVAW included, continued to operate after the war to bring attention to veterans issues. One leader of VVAW, John Kerry, spoke to a Senate Panel about his experience in the war and the reasons why it should end. Events like this increased public awareness of the war and swayed opinion against it. On the right is a short clip of the speech, with the full version seen here . 1971 May Day Protests The VVAW demonstrations carried over into a series of protests in early May that aimed to hinder government function by overflowing the city with protesters. Their rallying cry for the protest was \u201cif the government won\u2019t stop the war, the people will stop the government\u201d. Some 12,000 people were arrested over three days in what remains one of the largest mass arrests in US history. When unable to camp outside due to weather and police crackdown, protesters were housed in local colleges and churches, being provided food and shelter for their efforts. This was just one of countless massive protests against the war. Women\u2019s Movements for Peace Several womens groups protested the war, using their positions as mothers, sisters, and wives of soldiers to advocate for a need to end the conflict. Groups like Women Strike for Peace (WSP) and the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) advocated against the war through mass protest, organization, and dissemination of antiwar materials. Over 5,000 women marched on Washington in a protest known as the Jeanette Rankin Brigade. Other groups, like the Third World Women\u2019s Alliance, fostered connections between American and Vietnamese women to discuss positions on ending the war. Networks like these allowed for news from inside Vietnam to enter activist circles within the US, helping to counter media narratives about the war that dominated American society. University of Washington Student Protest following Kent State killings Veteran protests were particularly effective in making the news and swaying public opinion. This particular one from April 23, 1971 was referred to as the VVAW Operation Dewey Canyon III . It involved veterans or their families giving back their medals in public protest of the war and their part in it. After many days spent protesting, the demonstration culminated in the throwing of medals. The video to the left shows veterans saying their name and rank before throwing their medals on the steps of the capital. The following day, an estimated half a million people marched in DC to protest the war. Other veterans came forth to report atrocities committed by the US military in Vietnam. One of the most public of these was the My Lai Massacre , which gained massive attention and drove public opinion away from the war. May Day Protesters fill the steps of the Capital Building in Washington DC (left), a protester is chased by a member of the Capital Police (right), a flyer for the May Day protests detailing intentions and tactics (below). Student Activism During the Vietnam War era, college campuses across the country exploded in protests about student conditions, the Vietnam War, and issues ranging from Feminism to Civil Rights. Groups like the SNCC , SDS , and SMC all organized students against the war, with SNCC later becoming increasingly active in the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. While often dismissed by conservative media as lazy youth, students worked tirelessly in events like Freedom Summer , which saw students from across the country travel to Mississippi in droves to help black communities register to vote and learn about systems of oppression. After facing intense harassment and violence from law enforcement and opponents to the Civil Rights movement, students returned home resolved to continue activist struggles and emboldened by their experiences. Killings at Kent State and Jackson State On May 1, 1970 mass protests broke out across the country following President Nixon\u2019s announcement of plans to invade Cambodia, expanding the Vietnam War. Three days later, on May 4, student protesters at Kent State University in Ohio were fired upon by the National Guard, killing four and injuring nine in an event that shocked the nation. This event followed three days of escalating protests in and around the school, and showed that not even students were safe from state violence. Not two weeks later on May 15, a gathering of black students at Jackson State University was disrupted by police gunfire killing two and injuring twelve. Although this event gained far less media coverage, and although the Jackson State shootings were not based around an antiwar protest, both events highlight an increased willingness from the state to commit acts of violence against groups of students. Self-Immolation as Protest Violent resistance As desperation for the end of the war grew, some groups turned violent and carried out bombings of government facilities or universities that supported military research. The Weather Underground is one such example of antiwar activists turning to violence. Former members of SDS , the members of the Weather Underground carried out a series of bombings starting in 1969 targeting government buildings and employees who they saw as responsible for the war in Vietnam and a manner of social ills. While not popular among the larger antiwar movement, threats and actions of domestic terrorism caused the government to fear further escalation of violence and helped to hasten the end of the war. The FBI used organizations like this as an excuse to clamp down on other activist groups, citing a threat to national security. Student protester attacked by police dogs during Freedom Summer On June 11, 1963 Thich Quang Duc, a 73 year old Buddhist monk set himself ablaze in front of a large crowd, sitting in the lotus position as he burned to death on a main road. This particular act was done to protest the authoritarian actions of President Diem. This image taken by Malcolm Browne of the Associated Press became one of the most iconic images to come out of the Vietnam War. More info here On March 16, 1965 a woman named Alice Herz self-immolated in protest of the Vietnam War. At 82 years old, she became the first American to protest via self-immolation. She was an activist who had worked with SANE and WILPF for decades prior to her death.

In addition to this, the war was becoming increasingly unwinnable. This prompted Nixon to adopt a policy he named \u201c Vietnamization \u201d, which would attempt to shift the conflict back into the hands of the South Vietnamese, somewhat optimistically allowing the US to withdraw with the South in an advantageous position. Through this policy troop numbers continuously declined over a manner of years. Nixon continued the peace talks started by LBJ while American troops were returned home. Click here to see a video of troops hearing news of the ceasefire proposal Paris Peace Accords Nixon waves and flashes peace signs to a crowd outside the White House following his impeachment Prisoners of War Many American soldiers, particularly downed pilots, had been prisoners of war for several years. Part of the Paris Peace Accords included the return of US military personnel, many of which had been captive since the early years of the war. This image shows prisoner of war Robert Stirm seeing his family after returning from Vietnam. For many Americans, the pains they felt from this war were from losing loved ones overseas or missing their family members while they were off at war. While many prisoners of war were returned following the Paris Peace Accords, over one hundred died before making it home. War in Vietnam Continues US troops return from Vietnam, carrying signs honoring their fallen comrades. 1973 On January 27, 1973, Nixon announced the signing of the Paris Peace Accords , a treaty which ended US involvement in Vietnam and declared a ceasefire between the North and the South. While US troops did indeed leave by 1973, the North and South resumed fighting quickly, lasting for two more years until the north was able to invade and capture Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam. One year after ordering the withdrawal of US troops, Nixon would be impeached and removed from office following the Watergate scandal . Despite a ceasefire being a part of the Paris Peace Accords, both sides did not intend on keeping that agreement. While America had withdrawn its troops, the war was not yet over. There remained several thousand Northern troops in South Vietnam, and violence began almost immediately following the peace accords as the south tried to rid their territory of northern combatants. The Fall of Saigon After two years of skirmishes in the south, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had been gathering their forces and preparing for eventual fighting. After two years in 1975 they attacked the south in a dramatic push similar to the Tet Offensive. The southern government rallied but were unable to repel the assault, leading to the fall of Saigon . Quickly overtaking the city, the armies of North Vietnam took the city and the presidential palace, declaring victory and shortly thereafter renaming Saigon to \u201cHo Chi Minh City\u201d. In Hanoi on July 2, 1976 Vietnam was officially unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Civilians took to the streets to witness the events unfold, while Americans and American sympathizers hid for their lives. This picture on the left shows a tank on the streets of Saigon with soldiers riding on top in victory. The image on the right shows a tank riding through the gates of the Presidential Palace. The Fall of Saigon would mark the end of the Vietnam War and led to the reunification of Vietnam."

Borrowing tactics from each other and hoping to enact political and social change, movements ranging from Women\u2019s Liberation to Prisoner\u2019s rights began protesting and campaigning to improve their conditions. Second Wave Feminism/Women\u2019s Liberation Within a growing Women\u2019s Liberation movement, several groups of women were formed and took up political activism to protest cultural sexism, reproductive rights, work equality, and the Vietnam War among countless other issues. Women\u2019s groups often used their position as mothers, partners, and sisters to protest the war in Vietnam. This is just a small sample of the groups active at the time. Women Strike for Peace Mainly concerned with nuclear disarmament, this group is responsible for a nationwide strike of over 50,000 women. They are regarded as having played a large part in the passing of a 1963 treaty between the US and Soviet Union that banned nuclear testing. More info on WSP here Third World Women's Alliance Largely influenced by Cuba\u2019s political structure, this radical feminist organization sought to fight against sexism and racism faced by women of color. Working with other racial justice movements and causes, they actively sought an end to the Vietnam War. More info here Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Starting in 1915 from a desire to end WWI, this antiwar coalition now has subgroups in over 40 countries. They worked alongside Vietnamese women to protest the Vietnam War, and continue to work today on disarmament. More info on WILPF here Jeanette Rankin Brigade More of an event than a group, this protest saw 87-year old former politician and activist Jeanette Rankin lead a group of over 5,000 women to Washington DC to protest the Vietnam War. The protest was viewed widely as a success and was the first mass protest of women at the capitol. More info here Gay Liberation The homophile movement had existed for decades by the late 60s, but the Gay Liberation movement is credited as starting in earnest following the Stonewall Uprising in 1969 (also called the Stonewall Rebellion or the Stonewall Riots). Earlier events like a raid on a San-Francisco cafeteria dubbed the Compton\u2019s Cafeteria Riot had seen open defiance of police intervention in gay clubs, but Stonewall truly ignited the movement and is still celebrated in yearly Gay Pride events throughout the country. Stonewall was a gay club in Greenwich Village, NY and was frequented by members of the LGBT community despite such businesses being illegal at the time. Laws forbid same sex couples from dancing in public, but the mafia owned and operated several bars and clubs that turned a blind eye, charging extra for cheap drinks and having largely unsanitary conditions , but creating a relatively safe space for the community to exist. Image from one of the first Gay Pride parades, on the first anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, 1970. AIM and Indigenous Rights The Stonewall Inn in modern times The Stonewall Uprising occurred following an unannounced police raid on the Stonewall Inn, during which the patrons fought back against the police, creating a riot which lasted days and birthed the Gay Liberation movement. This movement saw LGBT people across the country protest and form organizations that advocated for an end to discrimination on the basis of sexuality and acceptance into larger society. A large focus was placed on \u201ccoming out\u201d and not hiding one\u2019s sexuality. While not often part of the mainstream narrative, the transgender community was integral to the police resistance and radical activism of the early Gay Liberation movement. Often times transgenderism is thought of as a specifically modern concept, but trans people have been around for thousands of years, and have acted as the vanguard of LGBT social movements in the US for decades. The American Indian Movement was a pro-indigenous rights organization that organized and protested for better conditions for North American Indians. Though not the only Indigenous rights group of the time, their bold protests and occupations of government land like Alcatraz Island garnered them media attention and public support. They organized many major protests at sites of historical atrocities against the Indigenous people of the United States, and continue to operate to this day, advocating for better conditions for Indigenous people. AIM and its major protests came at a time of massive racial unrest in the country, as many groups ranging from Asian to Black to Chicano sought to protest the lack of racial equality and the conditions that perpetuated it in America. AIM built off these movements by including American Indians into the fold, carrying out protests attempting to spur legislative changes within the treatment of tribes. Most of these groups felt solidarity with one another, exchanging information and tactics. Some of AIMS largest protests include the Longest Walk and the occupations of Alcatraz , Wounded Knee , and the Bureau of Indian Affairs . Members of AIM escort the Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harlington Wood to the occupied village of Wounded Knee, March 1973. I would like to note that this is a small sample of the massive number of political advocacy groups operating at the time. It is tempting to try and list them all, but I encourage anyone reading this to look at some of these links and further research the different activism occurring during the Vietnam era and in the time since. Many of these organizations are in dire need of funding and support, and most of them accept volunteers. There are thousands of organizations not listed, so I encourage you to look into organizations in your state/city. Most donations are tax deductible!"

More info here Korean War (1950-1953) The first act of war within the Cold War. American forces backed democratic South Korea and the Soviets supported North Korea, creating a conflict that is still ongoing to this day. More info here Rising Social Tension Following WWII, several oppressed groups began to work together to demand equal rights. Women, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community all began to seek better conditions in social movements that would continue to grow in the following decades. More info here Modern Living In the postwar era, many Americans felt entitled to modern comforts, suburban homes, and a peaceful domestic life. Many former GIs were able to enjoy these material comforts due to the GI Bill , while most people of color found themselves excluded despite their military service during the war. This way of life was depicted by the government as being threatened by Communism. More info here Shifting Sentiments, Values, and Allies WWII posters from the US military aimed to help Americans trust Russians, but shortly after the war they were vilified and depicted as fundamentally un-American. Prior to World War II, America was largely isolationist . After the first World War, many Americans felt that the country did not see enough of a benefit for its role in the fighting, and as such wanted to stay out of foreign affairs. The public was slowly swayed by the events happening in Europe during WWII, and once Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, public sentiment swelled in favor of joining the war. By the time war was over and peace was declared, American public sentiment had shifted towards interventionism. While allies during the war, tensions between America and the Soviet Union grew towards the end of the conflict, with the atomic bomb and the sharing of atomic technology (or lack thereof) becoming a point of contention between the two countries. The Soviet Union had suffered massive casualties in comparison to the other allied countries, and felt as though the atomic bomb could have prevented Russian lives from being lost had it been shared or used sooner. America wanted to keep the knowledge of the bomb private, and with the deaths of FDR and Stalin, political relations soured further. Both countries continued to stockpile weapons after the war ended. This cartoon represents America\u2019s blind willingness to offer monetary aid to fight against Communism Growing government power fuels social movements An American military adviser trains a Vietnamese soldier, 1962. As communism became a fear of the government, propaganda was employed to present the Soviets as quintessential enemies to all that is American. Communism became a scapegoat for a plethora of social ills, and various oppressed groups were labeled communist, barring them from government jobs. In reality, Communism was just a red herring. Suspected communists, gays, and lesbians faced harassment from hiring boards which held mock trials to discern the sexuality and political opinions of applicants; supposed LGBT individuals were even outed in lists that were available to the public. Eventually, gay individuals were barred from government jobs entirely. This discrimination would later help to fuel the Gay Liberation movement. Participation in labor groups or groups associated with communism in any form justified government monitoring and harassment. Various groups within the government like the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) were established in order to investigate supposed communists or otherwise \u201csubversive elements.\u201d American assistance in the first Indochina War: the Truman Doctrine in Action After the end of World War II, France attempted to regain their former colonies in Indochina (modern Vietnam). Following the end of World War II and the defeat of the Japanese (who during WWII occupied Vietnam), Vietnam declared itself independent, creating a conflict between the Vietnamese and the returning French (more details given in later section). America, vowing to support their allies, assisted the French despite their alleged goal of ending colonialism in the modern age. As the French became less able to fight an increasingly independent colony over time, the US pledged an increasing amount of financial support, sending money and military advisors to Vietnam to help cement French control. As French control over the region waned, Americans took the conflict over from their ally and made it their own. By the end of the First Indochina War, the US had covered over 80% of the cost of the war, around $2.6 billion USD. Escalation in Vietnam Due to its large investment in the region, the US continued operations in Vietnam to support the pro-western south, which was previously occupied by the French. Financial, military, and political support continued to increase over time. Under President John F. Kennedy the conflict was escalated, but only once President Lyndon B. Johnson took office did we enter into an official military conflict, on March 8, 1965. LBJ greets American soldiers in Vietnam, 1966. 48,399 American soldiers would die in Vietnam during President Johnson\u2019s time in office. Truman Doctrine and International Policy American international policy saw a shift in this era, exemplified in President Truman\u2019s 1947 speech outlining the \u201c Truman Doctrine \u201d, which served as Americas general policy during the Cold War era. Pledging incredible sums of money for foreign aid, Truman vowed to \u201csupport free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\u201d While the wording is vague and applicable to a variety of situations, this effectively meant that the United States would use its wealth and military power to prevent the spread of communism abroad, wherever in the world it may be. Policies like this led to US involvement in Korea and Vietnam, as well as other freedom struggles across the globe. Oftentimes however, America was not protecting freedom, but their own interests in capitalism and democracy that would benefit America through trade deals or political allies. Opponents of the US like Ho Chi Minh would later use this hypocrisy against America, pointing out that the US often acts against their stated values on the world stage."

With the supposed end of the world on the horizon, many Americans focused on what they could control within family units, leading in large part to the baby boom . A growing culture war against that which was viewed as un-American meant a return to traditional values in the mainstream and a general fear that carried through the Cold War era. The social climate likewise lent itself to movements of social change, as many were becoming increasingly aware of the flaws within American society. The war in Vietnam happened at a point when many Americans, specifically students and other young people, were becoming increasingly critical of the country and its policies. This led many Americans critical of the war into political/protest groups, educating them about global struggles for freedom and connecting them with other student activists. This helped to create a global network of political resistance movements that was able to transfer ideas and tactics. The Cold War is a term used to describe the ideological conflict between the US (who represented capitalism) and the Soviet Union (who represented Communism). After the end of World War II both countries saw an increase in tensions that led to a race to stockpile weapons, get to the moon, gain spheres of influence, and overall win a cultural battle to determine which form of government was superior. Although proxy wars and espionage between the two countries did occur, the conflict never escalated to full on war, largely out of fear that doing so would trigger an atomic war and mutually assured destruction . The Iron Curtain While not riveting by modern standards, this speech along with the Truman Doctrine showcase examples of early Cold War political rhetoric. Speaking at a college in Missouri in 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of an \u201c Iron Curtain \u201d descending upon Europe and the world. A metaphor for Communism and Soviet expansion, this new term rallied people against the Soviets. This speech showcases the rapid deterioration relationship between the Soviets and the West just one year after World War II ended. The Soviets were distrusting of the West largely due to conflicting ideologies and the US withholding atomic technology from them during and after World War II. The west was both wary of their political systems as they threatened capitalism, and concerned with Soviet expansion that created the so-called \u201cIron Curtain\u201d. NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is a military alliance between several western countries that pledges to come to each other's aid if any member is attacked. To counter this, several Eastern Bloc countries created the Warsaw Pact, a similar treaty meant to guarantee mutual defense between allies. These were the two main factions of the Cold War. Cold War Alliances Films like the James Bond series entertained Americans while reinforcing Cold War stereotypes. The hero, Agent 007, would often fight cartoonishly evil Russian villains. (Movie poster from 1963) NATO Formed in 1949, western countries allied in a defensive pact, promising to come to each others aid should one member be attacked. Find more info here Warsaw Pact As Cold War tensions rose, the Soviet Union and surrounding Eastern European countries created their own mutual defense pact in 1955, creating a counter to NATO. Find more info here Vietnam on a world map, positioned between the USSR and the USA Vietnam on a world map, positioned roughly between the US and the USSR Spheres of Influence This world map shows the distribution of NATO & Warsaw Pact countries and allies. A more detailed view of the Soviet Union and its surrounding territories. At the time of its existence, the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) was the largest nation on earth, and the most ethnically diverse, consisting of 15 republics and encompassing an area of almost 9 million square miles, around 2.5 times the size of the US. Cold War expansion draws attention to Vietnam Each side in the Cold War sought to gain territory through military expansion or political alliances. As both sides competed for greater spheres of influence, Vietnam became increasingly desirable for both countries. For the US, it would grant them a foothold in an otherwise heavily Communist area of the world. China and Russia feared US control of Vietnam, resulting in a drawn out conflict where Northern Vietnam saw Communist support and Southern Vietnam saw support from the west, mainly the United States. Vietnam would become a keystone conflict of the Cold War, lasting decades and shifting global power dynamics."

According to Vietnamese historians, Vietnam won the war. In America, things are not so clear cut and many still have trouble admitting defeat, largely as this was America\u2019s first time being defeated in war. There was national shame and backlash against veterans, who many viewed as war criminals, bringing shame to the country for both the dishonorable actions of the military and the humiliation of defeat. The Vietnam era however remains celebrated for its activism and political movements, many of which shape social movements in the US today. There has also been a shift in sentiment about soldiers in the war, with a modern view to \u201chate the war, not the soldier.\u201d The war also brought attention to POWs , with flags commonly being flown to commemorate POWs and those who were MIA (missing in action). The US has also seen implementations of Asian studies programs and a movement towards better education surrounding the Vietnam War. This is one of the main reasons that I started this project, as despite the growth in education on the war, many (including myself) only know a few key details and lack a proper understanding of the historical importance of the conflict. Many Americans who did not grow up during the war instead learn about it through brief mentions in class or through memes on the internet (shown above). This creates a lack of understanding and can perpetuate harmful ideas, like the notion that the Vietnamese were simple farmers who won by luck. Although a hard truth for some to swallow, the Vietnamese were able to win the war due to determination, modern weaponry, and advanced tactics that took advantage of America\u2019s position as an occupying force. It is important to learn about the war in Vietnam and have discussions about our history so that we can do better in the future and remedy our mistakes of the past. Many within the Civil Rights and antiwar movements went on to continue activism after the Vietnam era. John Kerry (mentioned in the antiwar protests veterans section) went on to have a career in politics, eventually running for President. Coretta Scott King also had a lifetime of activism that lasted far after the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s ended. One problem I have run into with this project is that with such a vast scope, I have to omit several important individuals and groups. There are thousands of Americans and Vietnamese who have continued advocacy work after becoming politically active during this era, which again points to the importance of this time in American society. To name them all would turn this website into an encyclopedia, but to not acknowledge them would be unfair to the legacy of activism that so many contributed to. These memes dominate internet discussion about the Vietnam War, and say a lot about modern opinions of the conflict. It is important to better understand the conflict and not perpetuate these ideas, even if it is just for humor. Misconceptions about the Vietnamese There\u2019s so much more that I can say about the legacy of the Vietnam War today, but in completing and sharing this project I hope to teach people to be more knowledgeable and open minded about the conflict, while encouraging them to do their own research on the era. Racialized views of the Vietnamese too often permeate our culture in the years following the war, and in order to move forward we need to facilitate a better relationship between the US, Vietnam, and the world as a whole. If you\u2019ve made it this far, I truly cannot thank you enough. I strongly encourage you to revisit this project at your leisure, as the links out contain far more information than I could ever hope to include in this website, and are told by people with far more experience and wisdom than I. Many other historians have put massive effort into telling the stories of the Vietnam War era, and their work deserves to be recognized. I urge anyone reading this to do their own research, as there are things that I surely missed and there is far more to this conflict than I have discussed. Still, I hope that this project has helped you to gain a better understanding of the Vietnam War and its effects on American society. Thank you. There are misconceptions about the capabilities of the Vietnamese fighting force that largely date back to US propaganda during the war. American memes and jokes likewise portray the Vietnamese as exclusively \u201cViet-Cong\u201d, despite that only being a segment of the soldiers. They also perpetuate the idea that the Vietnamese soldiers were poor, dirty peasants. While commonly depicted as \u201c simple farmers \u201d, the Vietnamese military was a modern fighting force that although outgunned by the US, was still able to wage war with a major world power and win. To dismiss them as peasants with sticks is to perpetuate a US narrative of American superiority."

More info here Nation of Islam Founded in 1930 by Wallace Fard Muhammad, this organization of Black Nationalists had a strongly religious foundation in Islam, and sought independence and Black unity through religion. More info here SNCC Originally founded in 1960 as a student led racial justice organization, this nonviolent group eventually aligned themselves with the Black Panthers, favoring more radical resistance over their original nonviolent methods. Teach-ins, sit-ins, and other events organized by SNCC aimed to bring attention to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements.

More info here Angela Davis Working for Black, LGBT, feminist, prisoner, and general human rights, Davis has had a long career involving time in prison which prompted thousands to protest for her release. She remains a cultural leader to this day, focusing on black lgbt women. More info here Origins of the Civil Rights Movement Adjacent to the Civil Rights movement was a movement for Black Power, which sought to gain equal rights through more revolutionary means. Some groups sought outright revolution, while others advocated for a separate ethnostate. Many joined groups like the Black Panthers and fought as a community to gain rights for Black Americans while fighting against police oppression and general disenfranchisement. The Black Power movement was far less accepted than the Civil Rights movement, as it was far more disruptive to the status quo of white America. Open conflicts with police caused fear in many who saw the Black Power movement as threatening, but there were other programs that were carried out to bolster the black community. The Black Panthers are known for instating one of the first free breakfast programs in the country. Targeting low income urban black communities, the Black Panthers obtained and distributed food in order to make sure that no child went hungry. While later adapted in many other parts of the country, the Party was villainized for this by the government which sought to end the program. Still, the program was regarded as a success and is a large part of the Black Panther legacy today. Protesters marching following the assassination of MLK Government targeting of Black Power and other social movements The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover viewed the Black Panther Party and the Black Power movement as a whole as the \u201cgreatest threat to the internal security of the country\u201d. As such, the leadership of the Black Power movement was often targeted by both the government and rival groups. The FBI was particularly weaponized against the Black Power movement with programs like COINTELPRO , which surveilled, infiltrated, and sought to disrupt the movement. Other leadership like Huey P. Newton of the Black Panthers were imprisoned, and many struggled to be released, prompting protests from their compatriots on the outside. The struggle to free Huey Newton from prison became central to the Black Panther party who sought to free their imprisoned leader. Ideological struggles with the mainstream civil rights movement included feelings that leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. were too conciliatory. Many within the Black Power movement felt as though peaceful resistance wouldn\u2019t gain the freedom they desired, leading to disagreements on tactics and goals. The death of MLK caused many to lose faith in the nonviolent tactics used by groups like the SCLC. Riots broke out across the country following his assassination, and many pivoted to the more violent or assertive goals of the Black Power movement. With a strong Christian foundation, the Civil Rights movement of the 50s-70s began in earnest with the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955. Led by MLK , this boycott of a segregated bus line led to widespread violence from angry whites and the formation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a group that would become central to the Civil Rights movement. They would go on to plan the March on Washington , one of the largest protests in American history. Students doing a sit-in at a Woolworth\u2019s have drinks poured on their heads by jeering onlookers. New tactics of nonviolent resistance like sit ins (used heavily by SNCC) were used to point out that integration was not a threat to whites. This didn\u2019t stop outrage from occurring, as many saw this as an affront to the societal order of Jim Crow segregation. While originally a nonviolent group advocating for civil rights, SNCC became more radical under the leadership of Stokely Carmichael (later Kwame Ture). The group went on to work with the Black Panthers and advocated for Civil Rights using more revolutionary tactics and rhetoric than their original sit-ins and teach-ins. Black Power The Black Panther aesthetic of black leather jackets and berets became synonymous with the Black Power movement. Members of the party are seen here with \u201cFree Huey\u201d signs protesting their leaders imprisonment."

Tensions still remained with Cambodia , and within two years Vietnam went from fighting along the border to open war, which lasted until 1991 when peace was finally declared. With the war in Cambodia hurting their global reputation and angering China, Vietnam took years to recover and establish itself financially. In modern times, the conflict is looked on more favorably for the Vietnamese, as the Khmer Rouge (the political faction that the Vietnamese fought against in Cambodia) and its leader Pol Pot had committed genocide against the people of Cambodia and were finally ousted by the Vietnamese invasion. Diplomacy and modern Vietnam Ongoing efforts continue to try and fix the damage that the war caused to the Vietnamese landscape. It is estimated that complete cleanup could take up to 300 years, with much of the country having been covered in agent orange and more being devastated by explosives, many of which remain active. Over 100,000 people have been killed or injured by unexploded ordinance since the end of the war, many of them children. Nonprofits and environmental groups from across the globe like RENEW Vietnam have partnered with Vietnam to help clear the land and make it safe again. The US has helped to fund many of these projects, with people from both countries working together to repair the damage that the war caused. Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia Diplomacy and trade talks with the US in the 1990s, economic reforms, and with admittance to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) helped to restore Vietnam to a position where it had many allies and saw massive growth in GDP and global diplomacy. Now, Vietnam has many trade partners, a strong economy, and a national focus on tourism which draws people from around the world. Click here to look at the Vietnamese tourism website.

The NVA and the NLF used guerilla tactics, operating in small numbers and conducting hit and run style raids before disappearing into a network of trails in the forest. The US soldiers would often conduct \u201csearch and destroy\u201d missions, where they would travel along specific routes hoping to find enemy troops or encampments. These operations often had high fatalities, as low level grunts were used as bait to attract the enemy troops. When enemies were found, the US soldiers would often call for an airstrike, fleeing the area while doing so. It is estimated that as much as 20% of US fatalities in Vietnam came from friendly fire , as bombers were relatively inaccurate and nondiscriminatory about their targets. Women in the War Explore a database of more images of women in the NLF here This infographic shows uniforms typical of the NVA and Vietcong Over the course of the war, over 9 million US military personnel served, with 3.4 million of them serving in Southeast Asia. Over half of them regularly saw combat or faced attacks from the enemy. By the end of the war 58 thousand US soldiers had been killed. 25% of the US armed forced in Vietnam were draftees, with 76% of the men sent to fight being considered working class. This was a contrast from prior wars, and since less people were drafted in Vietnam than in WWII, the age was lower and the socioeconomic status shifted towards poor people being sent to war. While WWII saw an average soldier age of 26, the average American soldier in Vietnam was only 19 years old. Black soldiers made up an estimated 12.5% of the US fighting force, but were dying at a higher rate early in the war due to being sent into far more dangerous situations than white soldiers. This was somewhat remedied later in the war following massive protest, but it was never truly resolved. It is worth noting that while 58,000 US soldiers died, over 1 million Vietnamese combatants and up to 2 million civilians were killed. While the US participated in the war, it was largely fought between the North and South Vietnamese, meaning that they saw far more death than the US armed forces. US soldiers wore jungle fatigues to fight in Vietnam and blend in with their surroundings. While movies tend to depict soldiers in Vietnam as rugged older men, they were often young and drafted right out of high school. US Troop numbers in Vietnam The number of US troops in Vietnam peaked in 1968, at 543,000 active duty personnel. While unable to fight on the front lines, an estimated 10,000 women served in Vietnam in the US military. Despite mainly serving as nurses, eight American women were killed in Vietnam. Members of the red cross, \u201c Donut Dollies \u201d, (image to the right) were sent to Vietnam to improve troop morale and entice them by reminding them of American women back home. Held to a high standard of traditional femininity and intended to be alluring but non-promiscuous, the Donut Dollies specifically contrasted the Vietnamese women that soldiers often solicited for sex. This created a class divide between the American women and Vietnamese women, prompting the hyper-sexualization of Asian women by US soldiers along with a vilification of them for viewing them as the enemy. It was not uncommon for local women to face intense harassment from soldiers. Vietnamese women on the other hand participated directly in combat, both as combatants and more commonly in a support role. Traveling along with the soldiers, Vietnamese women would provide ammunition to the front lines, report enemy troop movements, work as medics, maintain camps, and work with youth volunteers to create trails that allowed for troop transport across the country. These are just some of the ways that they were part of the war effort. Many Vietnamese women turned to prostitution during wartime, soliciting US soldiers outside of bases. While this was technically not allowed, US soldiers frequently hired these women, some of whom would report intel back to Vietnamese forces. While acting as soldiers, nurses, supply runners, and acting as the backbone of the North Vietnamese war effort, Vietnamese women still raised families and took care of children at home. After the war, many women faced fertility issues and various health issues from the physical stresses of combat and chemical exposure, creating a stigma against female veterans in the years after the war. More info here about Vietnamese women in the war. Fragging The growing controversy of the war prompted tensions between soldiers and their officers, and instances of soldiers killing their officers became so common that a new term, fragging , was coined to describe this. This term was used because it was common for soldiers to kill officers with \u201cimproperly thrown\u201d frag grenades. Fragging was incredibly hard to prove. By 1972 the government had reports of over 800 confirmed and suspected instances of fragging, while fearing that another 1,400 officer deaths could have been perpetrated by the soldiers under their command. Growing protests within the military furthered fears of disorderly conduct and soldiers abandoning their duties. Motivations Cartoon of a US soldier \u201cfragging\u201d his officer Troops in Vietnam came from a variety of backgrounds within both sides, sharing a common goal of defending their country from outsiders. American soldiers were often young and either drafted or wanting to serve in an honorable war, leading to disappointment and fear when they realized how different combat in Vietnam was from the stories from their parent\u2019s generation serving in WWII. Vietnamese armed forces had been fighting outside aggression for far longer than the US soldiers served. A Vietnamese soldier could feasibly fight in the war, have a child, and have that child grow up to fight in the same war. This created vastly different motivations for both fighting forces, along with the fact that the Vietnamese were fighting for their home. As the war continued, this divide became stronger, with US troop morale declining and the horrific treatment of the country by the US leading to a galvanized population of Vietnamese."

France returns with western support in an attempt to regain their lost colony. 1954 Decisive French defeat at the battle of Dien Bien Phu results in Vietnamese control of Northern Vietnam, but leads to the country being split along the 17th parallel. US takes over French operations in South Vietnam 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident: Naval engagement between the US and the Viet Minh that led to more direct US involvement in the war 1965 First American ground troops are deployed in Vietnam on March 8, marking a switch from using only military advisors to directly participating in combat. Operation Rolling Thunder begins. 1968 Tet offensive reinvigorates war by showing Vietnamese military strength. This counters US narratives about winning the war, causing antiwar sentiment to skyrocket. 1973 After years of reducing troop numbers, the US leaves Vietnam after signing the Paris Peace Accords. North Vietnam and South Vietnam are still at war. 1975 On April 30, 1975 North Vietnam captured the Southern Capital of Saigon, ending the war with a northern victory. 1976 A new government is established in Vietnam. Declared as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam with Hanoi as its capital. Saigon is renamed to Ho Chi Minh City. The War in Vietnam remains one of the most controversial conflicts within American society to this day. As the war progressed, many Americans felt as though there was no good reason for us to be in Vietnam, and the growing antiwar sentiment eventually overcame our fears of Communism. Press coverage of the war evolved over time from patriotic, to against the war, to apathetic; daily death counts were displayed on nightly news like a sports game. These death counts were the main way that the US measured progress in Vietnam. Bombing campaigns in Vietnam dropped more pounds of explosives on the country than that which was used in the entirety of World War II. The use of bombs against various supposed military targets led to immense collateral damage on civilian populations, killing an estimated 2 million, many of which were noncombatants. The destruction of villages and other populated areas generated more and more Vietnamese support for the war, drawing more into the conflict and creating a cycle of war that led to American defeat and withdrawal. The more villages that were destroyed, the more enemies the US made for themselves. Many former Vietnamese soldiers faced hunger and chemical exposure, harming their health and reproductive ability into modern times. In the US, the bombing campaigns drew massive protests and caused a loss of support for the war. Several pieces of unexploded ordinance remain in Vietnam to this day, and civilians, particularly children, continue to suffer. US involvement in Vietnam escalates over five presidencies An Invisible Enemy American soldiers often cited frustration with facing \u201can invisible enemy\u201d. They often couldn\u2019t see the people they were firing at, shooting into forests or firing explosives into supposed enemy positions. This was far different from what they expected due to previous wars. Many soldiers saw their comrades killed with no idea of where they were shot from. This constant death and lack of knowledge of their enemy often prompted increased aggression when they were able to find supposed combatants. This quickly created problems as it was nearly impossible to tell is a villager was a combatant, prompting constant violence against local populations that soldiers blamed for the deaths of their friends. While frustrating to the American soldiers, this speaks to the effectiveness of the guerilla tactics used by the Vietnamese. US Bombings of Vietnam The Tet Offensive War Crimes Throughout the course of the war, various atrocities committed by American soldiers against the Vietnamese came to light. Indiscriminate raids by American soldiers would attempt to find Vietnamese forces in remote villages: interrogating, imprisoning, or killing the inhabitants in searches that rarely yielded results. Countless war crimes perpetrated by US soldiers went unpunished. This hurt the reputation of American GIs fighting in the war and served to push the American public further in favor of ending the war. The My Lai massacre in particular served as a focal point for many as an example of American cruelty towards the Vietnamese people. Many still in favor of the war dismissed it as a hoax. In early 1968, the North Vietnamese staged an attack at various cities and military installations in South Vietnam dubbed the Tet Offensive . While technically a defeat for the North, the attack showed that the war was far from over and dealt a crushing blow to the morale of the US troops and general public. The video to the right is an overview of the Tet Offensive from the Smithsonian Channel, and shows footage of the combat around Saigon. American air superiority over the Vietnamese was used to quickly transport soldiers throughout the country and level large areas of land with bombs, chemicals, and machine gun fire. Because there was often poor intelligence surrounding the location of the enemy, American forces often leveled entire areas of forests where they suspected settlements to be located. US involvement in Vietnam lasted decades, and saw five presidents over the course of the conflict. Initially Truman was warned against US involvement in Vietnam, but chose to support France to help them rebuild after WWII. After the loss of the French military at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, Eisenhower\u2019s journal states \u201cI am convinced that no military victory is possible in that kind of theater\u201d. JFK initially decried US support for Vietnam as a congressman in the early 50s, stating \u201cI am frankly of the belief that no amount of American military assistance\u2026 can conquer an enemy which is everywhere and at the same time nowhere\u201d. Though initially against escalation, he later authorized napalm , agent orange , bombings, and the transfer of military equipment to the South Vietnamese. Months before he too was assassinated, Kennedy would support a coup against President Diem of South Vietnam. President Johnson greatly expanded US military operations in Vietnam following the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Under his presidency US troop numbers would reach their peak of 536,000 active duty military personnel. His successor, President Nixon, would market himself as a peacemaker, despite allegedly sabotaging peace talks to prolong the war. Nixon would adopt a policy of Vietnamization , attempting to gain \u201cpeace with honor\u201d, a vague hope that the US could withdraw without claiming defeat. The US finally left the conflict under Nixon, when it had become clear there was no path to US victory. This video from CBS news during the war shows an example of the type of combat US soldiers faced. This image from Saigon early in the Tet offensive shows South Vietnamese General Nguyen Ngoc loan executing NLF Captain Nguyen Van Lem in the middle of the street. Lem had been suspected of killing a South Vietnamese officer and his family days prior, and was caught near a mass grave. This execution happened live on TV, exposing America to the violence occurring in Vietnam. The Tet Offensive would claim the lives of an estimated 50,000 Vietnamese, but also drastically cut US support for the war and led to a reduction in troop numbers afterwards, eventually resulting in US withdrawal. This popular image referred to as \u201c Napalm Girl \u201d won a Pulitzer Prize for photographer Nick Ut, and focuses on a nude child, Kim Phuc, who was a victim of napalm bombing on a South Vietnamese village, after which she stripped her clothes off and sprinted down a main road in hopes of receiving medical attention for severe burns. She survived after being airlifted to a hospital."

More info here Vo Nguyen Giap One of the most prominent military leaders in Vietnam, responsible for controlling Vietnamese forces in the First Indochina war and the war against America. More info here French Indochina As a country, Vietnam has fought against outside oppression for centuries. First from China in ancient times, then France, Japan, and finally America. As both a country and a people, they were uniquely qualified to defy foreign resistance, and over time through both training, willpower, and military skill, they were able to gain independence from America and establish a modern country free of colonial control. North Vietnamese soldier waves a flag during Battle of Dien Bien Phu French control of Vietnam had its groundwork laid in initial missionary expeditions dating back to the 1600s, and expanded until France had gained complete control by the late 1800s. In 1887 the French created the Indochinese Union, which encompassed modern day Vietnam, Cambodia, and later Laos and the Chinese territory Guangzhouwan. Within the colony, France taxed common goods and implemented quotas in order to force spending. They also extracted natural resources such as coffee, timber, coal, and various metals. As France modernized, they used the resources of their colonies in Indochina to fund and build their country. While only numbering around 40,000, the French control over the region and insistence of the use of the French language ensured the entrenchment of French influence which permeates Vietnamese cuisine, art, and culture to this day. The French used local aristocrats and business owners to help exert their control over the region. The results were dire for the working class, which was forced to work on newly created farms which converted countless acres of the countryside to farms which exported crops to France. Education became more widespread, but it was mostly in cities and was designed to reinforce French supremacy. Opium was also used to control workers who became dependent on the substance, making them likewise dependent on vastly underpaid labor to support their habits. WWII: Japanese Occupation In May of 1940, Germany invaded France and quickly took control. This weakened France\u2019s colonial hold on Vietnam, prompting Imperial Japan to enter Vietnam in an attempt to close off Chinese borders during the Second Sino-Japanese War . Positioning themselves to the Vietnamese people as liberators from the French, Japan essentially colonized France\u2019s colony, allowing the French to retain control but ruling from behind the scenes in a puppet-state. This partnership with the French allowed Japan to control Vietnam with a relatively small force which at its peak only came to 35,000 soldiers. Taking advantage of pre-existing French transportation systems across the country, Japan used Vietnam as a staging ground from which to attack surrounding territories and gain control of the region. Towards the end of the war, Japan ousted all French members of the government, instilling the old emperor Bao Dai as a puppet ruler as their hold on the country weakened. In an attempt to protect French Colonial interests and prevent Japanese expansion, the US government used groups like the OSS to undermine Japanese control of the region by supporting revolutionaries like Ho Chi Minh and others in the Viet Minh. The August Revolution Ho Chi Minh delivers the Vietnamese Declaration of Independence in Ba Dinh square, Hanoi 1945. Geneva Accords Find more about Japanese control of Vietnam here . Following the defeat of the Japanese, their terms of surrender included ceding North Vietnam to China and South Vietnam to Britain. In the time before those forces were able to arrive, the Viet Minh, now totalling over 100,000 soldiers, took control of the North and declared independence as a new nation. Borrowing rhetoric from the United State\u2019s Declaration of Independence , Ho Chi Minh spoke to a crowd of over 400,000 in Hanoi, decrying colonialism and establishing the independence of Vietnam. His declaration can be found here . In only one weeks time, China sent a force of nearly 200,000 soldiers into Northern Vietnam, allowing Vietnam to remain independent but requiring the ousting of communists and the presence of French troops in the north for five years. Another part of the agreement detailed that control of South Vietnam would be given by the British to the French, who had returned to claim their colonial holdings. The Anti-French War When France returned to claim their lost colony, they began in the south, where the resistance from the Viet Minh was lower. The French bombing of Haiphong , a city in North Vietnam prompted retaliatory attacks from the Viet Minh, which were used as an excuse to declare war. The First Indochina War , known in Vietnam as the Anti-French War, had begun and would continue for almost eight years. Outgunned but far from outnumbered, the Vietnamese fought the French using guerilla tactics, which caused heavy losses and made the war unpopular within France. Over the course of the war, France struggled to keep control of their territory in South Vietnam. As of 1950, the US had recognized the pro-western Saigon (southern) government, while China and Russia supported the Viet Minh in the North. Still weakened after WWII, France sought help from the US to fund the war. Between 1950 and 1954, the US paid for over 80% of France\u2019s military operations in Vietnam. Battle of Dien Bien Phu French defeat in the First Indochina War was secured in the definitive Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954), a large French military base. General Giap (see above) had gathered a force of over 50,000 troops and thousands of local peasants. Several women were included and helped with a variety of tasks including keeping the camp, feeding the soldiers, carrying goods and ammunition to the front lines, and building and maintaining roads for military transportation. This large force brought artillery into the mountains where Dien Bien Phu sat, attacking the base in a months long battle that took the lives of an estimated ten thousand combatants. After heavy losses, the Vietnamese led by Giap were able to force the French to surrender the base. The day after Dien Bien Phu fell, France sought peace negotiations and several months later in late July the Geneva Accords were signed, bringing an end to the war. The treaty officially divided Vietnam in two (North and South), with the Viet Minh moving all troops north and France moving all troops south, with a ceasefire zone in the middle. On the right there is a simplified map marking the division of North and South Vietnam. The Geneva Accords also stated that there would be elections held within two years to determine the leader of a unified Vietnam, however the elections were cancelled at the last minute and a pro-western candidate, Ngo Din Diem, was instilled as president. It is widely assumed that Ho Chi Minh would have won a popular vote. While the Vietnamese had won the First Indochina War, American presence in the south suggested that further conflict between North and South Vietnam was yet to come.

The war coincided with a boom in social movements in the US, with a legacy of political action that is still drawn upon today. The conflict challenged American ideas on what the country stood for and whether or not its actions on the world stage were altruistic or nefarious. As one of our most recent and most polarizing conflicts, it is important for Americans to know the history of the war within both a global and national historical context. This project aims to compile information surrounding the origins, implications, and aftermath of the war in one setting, providing branching off points from which to learn more about discussed topics. On this website, anything underlined like this can be clicked on to take the viewer to supplementary sources that provide extra information. The structure of this website is done through a \u201ccourse\u201d, which can be skipped, skimmed, or studied at leisure. Sections are separated by topic, with occasional sections compiling images or video sources representative of their themes. Many websites and books provide either the Vietnamese or the American perspective, and it is important to learn both when learning about the war. This website aims to provide both in a simplified format so that people with and without prior knowledge are able to understand this incredibly multifaceted and misunderstood conflict. It is important to understand the discussions surrounding American involvement in the war and the many effects it had on our society, many of which can still be seen today. I hope that this website helps you to better understand the conflict and check out some of the other amazing resources out there designed to help teach the public about the Vietnam War. I would also like to note that this website is made for desktop view, and will be out of order if used on mobile. Modules Click the link below to begin!
